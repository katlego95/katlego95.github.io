Nomadic is a html/javascript browser game developed by Katlego Gaveni (November 2018) using Phaser.io library, tiled.io and free open source 
graphics.

The game is an ode to the classic mario brothers platform game. It features a scene in which our character must navigate to collect coins , all while 
avoiding obsticles and enemies. The game is supposed to serve as an educational tool aswell - the original idea was to create a game that would also showcase 
khoi-san history through the game play , game scenes and character. This first version only implements the game play , in the final version the background scene , character 
and all animations will be originals designs.

Game Controls:
A - move right 
D - move left 
W - jump
UP - shoot
