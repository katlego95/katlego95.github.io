        <h1>Transformation, the ice breaker.</h1>
        <h3>This is unquestionably one of the most controversial and sensitive topics within the sporting community. It’s a divisive conversation. Before we unpack this subject, it is only fair that we define and understand what exactly is meant by the catchphrase ‘TRANSFORMATION’ and why it’s giving people chest pains.</h3>
        Transformation is defined as “a complete or major change in someone’s or something’s appearance. “

</br>
The South African government adopted the philosophy of transformation in response to calls to mend a divided and unequal society as a result of decades of the implementation of the racial policy of Apartheid. South Africa was banned from participating in sports during Apartheid due to the old regime’s refusal to end racial segregation in all spheres of life, including sport. The transformation policy was instituted to ensure that the national sporting codes are representative of all the population groups.


</br>
Backlash is rooted from the misconception that transformation is “reverse racism” or the inclusion of players in a team purely based on colour and not merit. Those who share this mentality are the same people who are oblivious to the fact that the majority of the population still do not have access to sporting facilities or equipment and are therefore unable to nurture and develop their talents. This inconvenient truth is strifling any opportunity for disadvantaged population groups, particularly black sportsmen, from achieving provincial or national colours.

</br>

I am a hundred and twenty thousand percent behind this policy having experienced and witnessed unfair discrimination in sports first hand. I advocate for the so-called “quota system” as it ensures that a team is fairly represented, especially in traditionally “white sports” such as rugby, cricket and netball. Again, the inconvenient truth is that sporting opportunities are readily accessible to those who are privileged: Poverty, race or lack of resources is no excuse to exclude a player from selection.

</br>
However, I do concede that we cannot rectify transformation at national level. The problem is rooted at primary school-level, and then ripples onto high school, varsity, club-level and eventually at a national level. The irony is that critics say that there aren’t enough black players that filter through to premium division, but the quantity we see in Craven Week and Varsity Cup in rugby proves otherwise. Safe to say, it’s a selection issue – go figure.
</br>
The oppression of black people in sports is a suppressed narrative. Not only is it a strenuous task for a black sportsman to make it to professional level, those who have made it have hardly enjoyed longevity. Ever too often we ask “where is xyz now” or “what happened to xyz” when it comes to black players, yet white players tend to have long careers and proceed to broadcasting or sitting on boards of sporting organisations with little or no experience, upon retiring.
</br>
Great efforts have been taken to make sure transformation is a high priority in the sporting community. Last year, the Department of Sports and Recreation, penalized four federations – South African Rugby Union (SARU), Athletics South Africa, Cricket South Africa (CSA) and Netball South Africa (NSA) from bidding or hosting events for at least a year due to their lack of compliance to the transformation policy. Allister Coetzee is SARU’s shining knight, as his transformation achievements are exemplary and instil confidence that the Springboks shall reach their 50% racial split target for 2019.
</br>
To clarify, transformation was not introduced to fill up the national and provincial teams with black players but to merely facilitate that:</br>
A) Teams are fairly represented.</br>
B) All players are given the same opportunity.<br>
I am of the view that politicians should not meddle in sports unless the criteria for the transformation agenda are not met by a federation. The transformation agenda seeks to dismantle institutional structures and attitudes which perpetuate racial inequality in our society. We need to stop ‘blue ticking’ this matter and start approaching it with the seriousness we do when firing under-performing coaches.
